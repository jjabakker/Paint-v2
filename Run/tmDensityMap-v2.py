# Magnification is the factor at which you can try to make the grid smaller
# Magnification = 1 means you look at a grid of 81x81, with avery square 1x1 micrometer
# Magnification = 2 means you look at a grid of (2x81) x (2x81), with every square 0.5 x 0.5 micrometer
# Magnification = 10 means you look at a grid of (10x81) x (10x81), with every square 0.1 x 0.1 micrometer

# Cutoff means that you limit the highest value that can be displayed
# It is useful in a scenario when you might have 40,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,2,1
